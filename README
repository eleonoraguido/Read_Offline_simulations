This program reads Auger Offline simulations and creates reduced output files .root, storing only the variables that are used in the CNN analysis on SD signal traces.

Main source file is: extract.cc
Configuration file: config.txt
    The following options can be set:
        -input path
        -output path
        -type of particle (options: proton, photon, oxygen, iron)
        -minimum and maximum MC energy

To run the script locally:
source ../ADST_v3r99p3.sh
make
./extract 

For each input simulation file an output file is created. They can be merged together, for example:
hadd output_photon.root output_proton_*
